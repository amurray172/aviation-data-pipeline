# Aviation Data Pipeline

This project is an experimental application designed to enhance data engineering skills by building a data pipeline for processing aviation data. The pipeline extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) data from the OpenSky Network API.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Fetches real-time aviation data from the OpenSky Network API.
- **Data Transformation**: Processes and structures the data into a usable format.
- **Data Loading**: Outputs the processed data for further analysis or storage.
- **Logging**: Provides detailed logs for monitoring the pipeline's execution.
